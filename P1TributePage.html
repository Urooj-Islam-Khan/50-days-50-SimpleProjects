                <h2>Father of the Nation</h2>
                <p><span>The great leader and founder of Pakistan.</span> His real name is <span> Mohammad Ali Jinnah
                    </span> but widely known as
                    <span>Quaid-e-Azam or Baba-e-Qoum</span> which means the father of the nation. Quaid-e-Azam was born
                    on the 25th
                    of December in Karachi, in 1876. Quaid-e-Azam was a successful lawyer as well as a politician.
                    Quaid-e-Azam’s father’s name was Jinnah Poonja and his mother’s name was Mithibai. Quaid-e-Azam
                    belonged to a rich merchant family. Quaid-e-Azam received his early education from Sindh
                    Madrasa-ul-Islam and a Christian missionary school. He was sent to England at the mere age of 16 for
                    higher education and later got admission to Lincoln’s Inn Law school to study Law. He returned home
                    after studying abroad, then took over managing his family business.
                    Quaid-e-Azam was a man with great qualities and leadership. He was a human rights activist who
                    constantly fought for the rights of Muslims and dedicated his whole life to the liberation of
                    Pakistan. He tirelessly worked for the Muslims struggling in India and presented their concerns in
                    the 14 points which were rejected by Congress. He endured many hardships for the formation of
                    Pakistan and the rights of Muslims, but he did not give up. However, his efforts did not go
                    unrewarded.
